The Nutanix Sizing Reference Guide has been replaced with an updated, user-friendly training series on Nutanix University, **Sizing Fundamentals of the Enterprise Cloud**. This series covers all topics discussed in the retired Reference Guide, including new hands-on exercises, and has been expanded to cover new workloads and Sizer features.

Up-to-date questions for sizing discovery, covering multiple workloads, can now be found in `Sizer Help <https://sizer.nutanix.com/#/help/topics/32>`_.
